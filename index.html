        <h1>Haiii</h1>
        <p>I am a dumb developer that makes things like badly designed websites (you can see that), stupid projects based off of what I'm currently interested in, and things that can have some use. (may or may not be down rn :3)</p>
        <p>My current project(s) are getting my link service working (unless it is working) and getting a site centered around modding a certain game working properly. Not going to link it here because it is very incomplete...</p>
        <p>When I do program (kind of happening less and less) I either use Node, C#, or C++. </p>
